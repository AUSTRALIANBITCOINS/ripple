    Riak supports full-text search through an interface called
    "Riak Search."

    Enabling search takes several steps: making sure the cluster has 
    `riak_search` enabled, adding the precommit hook to the bucket you will
    be searching, and re-update the objects in the bucket.

    The Riak documentation describes 
    [enabling search on a cluster](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/references/Riak-Search---Settings/),
    [use cases for `riak_search`](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/tutorials/querying/Riak-Search/), and
    [working with search](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/cookbooks/Riak-Search---Indexing-and-Querying-Riak-KV-Data/).

    ## Search and Ripple

    Right now, Ripple does not support `riak_search`. Instead, use the Riak
    client that Ripple uses to make the search query, and instantiate
    Ripple objects from the results it returns:

    #{snippet 'riak_search_query.rb'}

    In this example, 

    [Formulating the query](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/cookbooks/Riak-Search---Querying/)
    is similar but distinct to writing a SQL query.
